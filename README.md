# Simple Facebook Scraper


Inspiration for this project came from the understanding that it was possible to gather and analyse freely available facebook data. Chat data in particular was of interest to me given the fact i have been using the platform as a primary use of socialiatstion and therefore had a lot of information to parse and produce meaningful results.

Various functions include:

1.  Frequency data for recipients in a given chat:
- This allows the user to gather data from any chat, either a 2 person chat, or a large, multi person conversation.
- Gives both the number of messages and the message proportion, showing who has spoken the most or the least.

2. Frequency of mentioned words or phrases
This function allows the user to either:
- See a chat participant's most frequent words or phrases mentioned. The user will be prompted to give a number, which represents how many words will be in the sequence - for example, 3 will produce the most 3 word phrases in the text, such as 'I love you'.
- Gives the opportunity for the user to input a phrase, to see how many times the word or phase has been mentioned in the chat.

3. Time frequencies
This gives the user to find out the most frequent time for each message in the chat, giving the opportunity to produce:
- A: Frequency by Hour
- B: Frequency by Month
- C: Frequency by Year
